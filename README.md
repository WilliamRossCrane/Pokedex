# Pokedex
After reading through a guide on building a Pokedex using TypeScript. I decided to take my project to the next level and add more features until I was happy with its functionality. This TypeScript Pokedex displays a responsive CSS grid of Pokemon Cards, each card contains information about the Pokemon details. At the top of the page, the search bar allows you to lookup any pokemon by its name listed on the card. 

## Built With
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JS
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - Markup language for web page
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Style sheets
